# Accessing Canvas From Home
* Or anywhere outside of our classroom
---
If you set up a Canvas account in class you can also access your account from a computer at home or with a smart phone.

## Using A Home Computer
1. Sign into your SKSD Google account (an easy way to do this is to go to https://helloid.skschools.org).
1. Go to https://canvas.instructure.com in your browser.
1. Click on the **G** (as in Google) icon under the Email and Password fields.
1. You should be taken to your Canvas page. Consider bookmarking this page so that it is easy to access.

## Using A Smart Phone
When you try and login to Canvas with a smart phone the first thing that you'll (probably) notice is that the array of authentication buttons is missing. If you try entering an e-mail address and password, you'll discover that it doesn't work. So…

If you have access to a desktop computer the nicest solution is to use the Canvas app. There is a version for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/canvas-student/id480883488) (iPhone and iPad) and also for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instructure.candroid&hl=en_US) devices. You only need access to the desktop (or laptop) computer for long enough to sign in to Canvas and display the QR code that authenticates you.

### Signing in to the Canvas app from a desktop computer
1. Install the **Canvas Student** app (there are links above).
1. Sign in to your Canvas account on a desktop (or laptop, including a ChromeBook) computer.
1. In the left hand sidebar, select **Account** and then choose the **QR for Mobile Login**. Canvas will display a large QR code.
1. Lanch the Canvas Student app on your phone. Under the blue Find my school button you should see a **QR Login** link. Click on it.
1. Take a moment to read the instructions, then click on **Next**.
1. Aim at the QR code on the desktop computer and you should be in.

## Signing in through your phone's browser
You can force Canvas to use the desktop site on your phone. It's not ideal, but it's (probably) better than nothing. Here's how to do it:
1. Go to https://canvas.instructure.com.
1. The next step depends on the browser you're using:
   * For **Safari**:
      1. In the address bar, at the top of the screen, click on the AA characters on the left side.
      1. In the resulting menu select **Request Desktop Website.** You'll be taken to the desktop version of the site.
      1. Click on the Google **G** icon to log in.
   * For **Chrome**:
      1. Click on the three dots in the lower right corner of the screen.
      1. In the resulting menu select **Use Desktop Website.** You'll be taken to the desktop version of the site.
      1. Click on the Google **G** icon to log in.

## If all else fails
If you're still stuck, see me on Zoom and we'll sort it out.
